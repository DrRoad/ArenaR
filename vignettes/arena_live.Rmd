```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  message = FALSE
)
```

## Setup
```{r}
library(arenar)

apartments <- DALEX::apartments
head(apartments)
```

## Prepare models
Let's compare three models: GLM and GBMs with 100 and 500 trees. For each we
create explainer from DALEX package.
```{r, results = "hide"}
library(gbm)
library(DALEX)
library(dplyr)

model_gbm100 <- gbm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments, n.trees = 100)
expl_gbm100 <- explain(
  model_gbm100,
  data = apartments,
  y = apartments$m2.price,
  label = "gbm [100 trees]"
)

model_gbm500 <- gbm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments, n.trees = 500)
expl_gbm500 <- explain(
  model_gbm500,
  data = apartments,
  y = apartments$m2.price,
  label = "gbm [500 trees]"
)

model_glm <- glm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments)
expl_glm <- explain(model_glm, data = apartments, y = apartments$m2.price)
```

## Run arena
It is not necessary to use dplyr's pipes, but it's designed to use pipes.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
arena <- new_arena(live = TRUE) %>%
  # Pushing explainers for each models
  arena_push_model(expl_gbm100) %>%
  arena_push_model(expl_gbm500) %>%
  arena_push_model(expl_glm) %>%
  # Push dataframe of observations
  arena_push_observations(apartments) %>%
  # Run server of default port and ip
  arena_run()
```

## Custom observation names
Oservations' names are taken from rownames. For example let's put district and
surface as observation name.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
apartments2 <- apartments
rownames(apartments2) <- paste0(
  1:nrow(apartments2),
  ". ",
  apartments2$surface,
  "m2 ",
  apartments2$district
)

new_arena(live = TRUE) %>%
  arena_push_model(expl_glm) %>%
  arena_push_observations(apartments2) %>%
  arena_run()
```

## Appending data
Sometimes you have already opened Arena session with static data, different live
server or other data source. You can add new data without closing that window.
Just use argument `append_data`.
```{r, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
new_arena(live = TRUE) %>%
  arena_push_model(expl_glm) %>%
  arena_run(append_data = TRUE)
```
